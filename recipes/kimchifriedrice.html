    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Kimchi fried rice (Kimchi Bokkeumbap, 김치 볶음밥) is a type of Korean fried rice and it is predominantly cooked with kimchi (obviously!)
            To give it more texture and flavor a variety of meat and/or vegetables are often added.

            So, when I make my kimchi fried rice I typically add bacon and mushrooms (particularly enoki mushrooms).
        </p>
        <p>
            Bacon gives a nice smoky flavor and enoki mushrooms give a nice crunchy feel to the dish.

            Besides, my husband loves meat just like any other male (I think?), so he won’t accept my kimchi fried rice unless it contains some meat in it! lol

            Kimchi fried rice is one of the most popular ways to use up your old ripened kimchi along with Kimchi jjigae (Kimchi stew) and Kimchi pancake.
